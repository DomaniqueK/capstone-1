Interesting Piece of Code:
Direct comparison of "double" values often leads to minor inaccuracies. To ensure the amounts are always accurate I used "Cents Check" to convert bot the transaction amount and the search amount into long integers (represented as cents) and compare those instead  

** if (searchAmount != null) { // Check amounts using cents **
   long transactionsCents = Math.round(t.getAmount() * 100); 
   long searchCents = Math.round(searchAmount * 100);
   if (transactionsCents != searchCents) {
   passesAllFilters = false;
   }
